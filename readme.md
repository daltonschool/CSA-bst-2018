# Binary Search Tree Assignment

### Base Assignment:

1. write contains (6pts)
2. write traverseInorder (6pts)
3. write randomizedSort and tester (4pts for sort, 2 pts for tester)

### Areas to explore:

##### WRITE DELETE

You will want to read the wikipedia page on delete,
and consider three cases:

- leaf delete (2 pts)
- single parent delete (2 pts)
- dual parent delete (2 pts)

The last one is trickier, do it one at a time.

##### MAKE IT A SELF BALANCING AVL TREE

you will need to change insert (6pts) and delete (5pts).
Read about this on wikipedia, and consider making a pointer
to each relevant node before you re-organize.

##### DRAW IT

Use lattelib to draw the BST.  You can make class function called BTree
consider making an interface to add/remove from the bst.
(Up to 10 points)

##### IMPROVE THE TESTER

Add some edge cases or improvements to the contains and traverse testers
